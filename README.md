# Analyzing_Historical_Stock-Revenue_Data_with_Examples

A look at my 1st project which I have done in IBM 5th Data Analyst Professional Certificate Track

I was guided through analyzing historical stock and revenue data with 2 examples 

"Tesla and GameStop" 

With the help of the new libraries I took in this course 

I learned a lot about the financial world 

I hope it won't be the last.
